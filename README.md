This is an implementation of a divide-and-conquer framework for causal discovery using a novel causal partition from the paper "Causal Discovery over High-Dimensional Structured Hypothesis Spaces with Causal Graph Partitioning" published in TMLR March, 2025.

A causal partition is a graph partition of a hypothesis space, defined by a superstructure, into overlapping variable sets. A causal partition allows for merging locally estimated graphs without an additional learning step, and provably recovers the Markov Equivalence Class of the true DAG. We can efficiently create a causal partition from any disjoint partition. This means that a causal partition can be an extension to any graph partitioning algorithm.
