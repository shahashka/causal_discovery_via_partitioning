## "Causal Discovery over High-Dimensional Structured Hypothesis Spaces with Causal Graph Partitioning"

### Abstract

The aim in many sciences is to understand the mechanisms that underlie the
observed distribution of variables, starting from a set of initial hypotheses.
Causal discovery allows us to infer mechanisms as sets of cause and effect
relationships in a generalized way – without necessarily tailoring to a specific
domain. Causal discovery algorithms search over a structured hypothesis space,
defined by the set of directed acyclic graphs, to find the graph that best explains
the data. For high-dimensional problems, however, this search becomes intractable
and scalable algorithms for causal discovery are needed to bridge the gap. In this
paper, we define a novel causal graph partition that allows for divide-and-conquer
causal discovery with theoretical guarantees. We leverage the idea of a superstructure
– a set of learned or existing candidate hypotheses – to partition the search space.
We prove under certain assumptions that learning with a causal graph partition always
yields the Markov Equivalence Class of the true causal graph. We show our algorithm
achieves comparable accuracy and a faster time to solution for biologically-tuned
synthetic networks and networks up to $10^4$ variables. This makes our method applicable
to gene regulatory network inference and other domains with high-dimensional structured
hypothesis spaces.
